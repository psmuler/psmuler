2024-07-01	(Planned)Scientists Have an Inherent Prioritized Queue in Selecting Collaborations	Contributed Talk	ICSSI	The paper analyzes the temporal dynamics of co-authorship in scientific publications, finding a fat-tailed interval distribution between recurring collaborations, which can be explained by a proposed priority selection model simulating multi-agent team dynamics based on co-authorship willingness. The findings suggest non-Poisson activity patterns in scientific collaborations.		http://academicpages.github.io/files/paper3.pdf
